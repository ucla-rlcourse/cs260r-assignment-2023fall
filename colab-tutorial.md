Before writing your code, please make sure you already click `File - Save a copy in ...` to transfer the ownership of the notebook to yourself:

### Some notes

You can use local machine and/or colab to edit and run your code. We don't constrain which platform you use.


Colab has usage limit. Please check colab policy very carefully to avoid your training being unexpectedly stopped or unsaved.
