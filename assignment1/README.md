Welcome to the first official assignment of this course! The objective of the Assignment 1 is to:

1. let you get familiar with the basic framework of reinforcement learning (RL), such as the agent-environment interaction loops. 

2. let you implement the basic tabular RL algorithms to solve a toy problem.

Please walk through the file: `assignment1.ipynb`.


### Finish the assignment

Open a shell and `cd` to current directory `./assignment1` . 

Start a jupyter notebook server via `jupyter notebook`. 

Open your browser and then open the `assignment1.ipynb`. 

**We left many `TODO` in the file. Following the instructions in the notebook and finish all `TODO`.** 

Make sure your code can be run without bugs. We will run the codes by `Restart & Run All` so make sure nothing stop the running.


### Submit the assignment

Following the procedure to submit your work:

1. Before submitting, remember to fill your name and student ID into the table at the top of the file.
2. Run your code in sequential manner, that is, run it by `Restart & Run All`. Remember to keep everything (the printed message) intact.
3. Generate the **PDF file** via `File / Download As / pdf ` to the assignment directory.
4. Zip the assignment directory to a **ZIP file**.
5. Submit the **PDF file** and the **ZIP file** to BruinLearn. The PDF file will should be submitted to [Gradescope tab in Bruinlearn](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu/courses/168678/external_tools/408) and the ZIP file should be submitted to the [Assignments tab in Bruinlearn](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu/courses/168678/assignments).
