    "\n",
    "1. `env.step(action)` To advance the environment by one time step through applying `action`. Will return four things: `observation, reward, done, info`, wherein `done` is a boolean value indicating whether this **episode** is finished. `info` is a dict containing some information the user is interested in.\n",
    "2. `env.reset()` To reset the environment, back to the initial state. Will return the initial observation of the new episode.\n",
    "3. `env.render()` To render the current state of the environment for human-being\n",
    "4. `env.action_space` The allowed action format. In our case, it is `Discrete(4)` which means the action is an integer in the range [0, 1, 2, 3]. Therefore, the `action` for `step(action)` should obey the limit of the action space.\n",
    "5. `env.observation_space` The observation space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the word **episode** means the process that an agent interacts with the environment from the initial state to the terminal state. Within one episode, the agent will only receive one `done=True`, when it goes to the terminal state (the agent is dead or the game is over).\n",

    "We will use `FrozenLake8x8-v1` as our environment. In this environment, the agent controls the movement of a *character* in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others are not, making to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.
