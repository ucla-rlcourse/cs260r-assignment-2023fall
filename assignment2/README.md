# Assignment 2: Deep Q Learning and Policy Gradient


Welcome to the assignment 2 of our RL course. Please walk through the file: `assignment2.ipynb`.

> NOTE: MetaDrive does not support python=3.12. If you are in python=3.12, we suggest to recreate a new conda environment:

```bash
conda env remove -n cs260r
conda create -n cs260r python=3.11 -y
pip install notebook  # Install jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook  # Run jupyter notebook
```


### Colab is supported

  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

<br>


Apart from editing and training locally, you can choose to use Colab. The instruction on how to incorporate Colab into the assignment can be found in our [Colab tutorial](../colab-tutorial.md).



### Finish the assignment

Open a shell and `cd` to current directory `./assignment2` . 

Start a jupyter notebook server via `jupyter notebook`. 

Open your browser and then open the `assignment2.ipynb`. 

**We left many `TODO` in the file. Following the instructions in the notebook and finish all `TODO`.** 

Make sure your code can be run without bugs. We will run the codes by `Restart & Run All` so make sure nothing stop the running.


### Submit the assignment

Following the procedure to submit your work:

1. Before submitting, remember to fill your name and student ID into the table at the top of the file.
2. Run your code in sequential manner, that is, run it by `Restart & Run All`. Remember to keep everything (the printed message) intact.
3. Generate the **PDF file** via `File / Download As / pdf ` to the assignment directory.
4. Use compression software to "zip" the assignment directory `assignment2/` to a **ZIP file**.
5. Submit the **PDF file** and the **ZIP file** to BruinLearn. The PDF file will should be submitted to [Gradescope tab in Bruinlearn](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu/courses/168678/external_tools/408) and the ZIP file should be submitted to the [Assignments tab in Bruinlearn](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu/courses/168678/assignments).
