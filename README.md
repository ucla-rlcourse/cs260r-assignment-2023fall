# CS260R: Reinforcement Learning

Welcome! This is the codebase for assignments of our reinforcement learning (RL) course. 

Please feel free to open issues if you find anything wrong or confusing in codes or documents in this repository. We will respond to you as soon as possible. If you get stuck or mess up, take a look at the latest version of this repo may help, since somebody may already raise issues and bug is fixed by new commits.

## General procedure of using this repo

Generally, the way you use this repo is:

1. Check the latest release at the time the tutor announced a new assignment is coming.
2. Read the assignment document, which is the `README.md` at each assignment directory.
3. Clone or download to get the code at your local computer.
4. Fill the empty functions, slots and cells we left for you. You can search `TODO` within jupyter notebook file to find them.
5. Follow the instructions in code comments to check if everything work well.
6. Follow the submission instruction in the assignments to submit your work in BurinLearn. (If you are formally enrolled.)

Beautiful code and comment make extra credits. Our aesthetic standard is [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Setup instructions

You can find local environment setup instruction in [assignment 0](assignment0).

Apart from editing and training locally, you can choose to use Colab. The instruction on how to incorporate Colab into the assignment can be found in our [Colab tutorial](colab-tutorial.md).
